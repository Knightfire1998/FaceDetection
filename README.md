# FaceDetection
#### In this project a simple face detector has been created using Haar Cascade Method.

# What is Haar Cascade ?
Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video and 
based on the concept of features proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001

# What are Haar Features ?
Haar features are sequence of rescaled square shape functions proposed by Alfred Haar in 1909. They are similar to convolution kernels 
taught in the Convolution Neural Networks course. We will apply these haar features to all relevant parts of face so as to detect human face.
